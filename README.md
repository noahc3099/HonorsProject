# HonorsProject

This repository will house my code and work on my Honors Scholars Project at Point Loma Nazarene University (2019-2020).

Title: Developing Remote Cameras deployed with Supervised Machine Learning for Remote Image Recognition with Applications.

Goal: Deploy a remote camera system that can A) accurately identify whether or not a parking spot is occupied and B) contribute to the observance and documentation of jungle wildlife in Costa Rica (in conjunction with Dr. Mooring's work at PLNU).
